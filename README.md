# Github_Project_Management
Tools for using the Github Api with Python to manage projects.
Both the project cards notebook and the Github issues notebook require the user to have a github api token saved in a text file called 'config.py'.  If you don't have one go [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to set one up.

The format for the text in the config file is:  
GITHUB_TOKEN = 'XX3f427f3d5f0ebXXXX40dd51cab9d1226a93eXX'
